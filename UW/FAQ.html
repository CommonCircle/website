									<dt>What is CommonCircle?</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><b>CommonCircle</b> Commoncricle uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to quickly notify users who have likely been exposed so you can help reduce the spread of COVID-19. CommonCircle allows users to find out if they’ve had an exposure to COVID-19 and to anonymously alert others if they are diagnosed positive with COVID-19 without sharing any personal information.</p>
                  </dd>
                  
									<dt>Who is the developer?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>CommonCircle is a grassroots collaboration between researchers at The University of Washington, UW Medical Center, and Allen Center of Science and Engineering, and Washington State Department of Health, with the support of volunteers from Microsoft.</p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>How does it work?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>When you use CommonCircle, your phone exchanges random, anonymous codes with other phones you’ve been in close range with. If you are within 6ft with another CommonCircle user for at least 15 minutes, your phones will exchange these random codes (or “tokens”) without revealing any information about you. If someone you've been in proximity with in the last two weeks tests positive for COVID-19, you’ll get an anonymous notification that you’ve had a possible exposure.</p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>Do I have to use CommonCircle in order to be on campus (does UW require it)?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>Using CommonCircle is voluntary, and no one is required to use it. The entire UW community is encouraged to use it because the more people use it, the more powerful it is as a tool in helping reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>What is an “exposure”?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>CommonCircle will let you know you’ve had a possible exposure to COVID-19 if a person you’ve been within 6 feet of for at least 15 minutes tests positive. This follows the current guidance from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html">the CDC</a> about social distancing and transmission of COVID-19. </p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>How is my privacy protected?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>You can learn more about how CommonCircle preserves your privacy while helping you reduce the spread of COVID-19 here: <i>[link to CC page on privacy - TBD]</i></p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>Will people know if I test positive?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>No. CommonCircle does not share any information about you with anyone else. When someone receives an exposure notification they will only know that someone they’ve been in proximity with in the last two weeks has tested positive for COVID-19. They won’t know who the person was, or where or when the exposure occurred.</p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>What happens if CommonCircle tells me I was exposed?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>When you get an exposure notification you’ll be given instructions about what to do next. In most cases you’ll be asked to contact XXX to get more information and find out about your options for testing, etc.</p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>The app isn’t working for me - where can I get technical support?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p></p>
                  </dd>
                  
                  <dt>Where at UW can I get tested for COVID-19?</dt>
                  <dd>
                    <p>Testing for UW students, staff, and faculty is available through the Husky Coronavirus Testing program. </p>
                  </dd>
