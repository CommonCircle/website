# CommonCircle technical page

This is the readme.md for the CommonCircle project, and https://commoncircle.us website (which looks nicer...)

This is the rough page outlining where you can find stuff related to CommonCircle.

There are two apps, 
* CommonCircle/Exposures - Google Apple Bluetooth Exposure Notification (GAEN)
* CommonCircle/Assist - help users and public health with issues related to contact tracing, case investigation, symptom mangement, decision support, and isolation and quarrantine

For now, here are some places to look for bits and pieces of the code
* https://github.com/CommonCircle - the eventual home for the University of Washington based Exposures and Assist codebases
* https://github.com/CovidSafe - a big chunk of CommonCircle began as CovidSafe
* https://github.com/orgs/uwcirg/projects/2 - a set of linked repos from the StayHome project which do or will contribute to CommonCircle

Repos from Linux Foundation Public Health-related projects
* https://github.com/CovidShield - the technical foundation of CC/Exposures
* TBD - a new repo for the LFPH core codebase for Assist
